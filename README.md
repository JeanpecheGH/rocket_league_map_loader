# Rocket League map loader
Custom map manager for Rocket League

## Getting started
To use this program, just download the [RLMapLoader.exe](https://github.com/JeanpecheGH/rocket_league_map_loader/releases/latest/download/RLMapLoader.exe) file.  
It's a simple binary that requires no installation.

Then, you simply have to pick the folder where you will put your custom maps, and then the game folder to configure it.

You can import each new zipped map using the "Menu (☰) -> Import new map" button.
Zipfiles are then unzipped in your custom folder.

Finally, you can load a map by using the LOAD button at the end of each line.
The original "Labs_Underpass_P.upk" will be backed up and you can restore it by using the "Restore original map"

## Renaming a map
The map name displayed in the app is based on the folder name containing the .upk file.  
So you just have to rename this folder to change the map name.  
You can access the custom folder easily by using the "Menu (☰) -> Open custom folder" button.

## Uninstalling
As this is a simple binary, you just have to delete the .exe file.  
The app preferences are stored in "C:\Users\MyUserName\AppData\Roaming\Jeanpeche\rocket league map loader" and you can delete this folder manually if you want to remove it entirely.
